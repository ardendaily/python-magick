TODO 

a) Refactor files of ./MagickAltar as following:
- whenever possible, have small, self-contained objects with clear, self-documenting functions.
- whenever possible, these objects should be nouns-- candle, paper, etc.

b) Move or refactor some files to ./MagickActions
- whenever possible, small, self-contained, etc.
- this time these are verbs -- actions to perform on magick objects

c) magickaltar.py (tentative filename)
- ipythonic, bpythonic, interactive shell for playing with magick.
- shoot for cross-platform compatibility
- this is just icing for those not looking to roll their own magick.
